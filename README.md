# TypeTwice
Autohotkey program to type on two applications at once<br>
Based on this thread: https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=44144<br>
## Installation / usage
1. Download AutoHotKey (https://www.autohotkey.com/)<br>
2. Specify window name (e.g. 'Document1 - Word') on line 81
3. Run `autohotkey kyall2.ahk` in cmd.exe.
4. Open another document / text file (e.g. Google Drive or notepad)
Now pressing a key will type to cursor location on both. Does not log compound key bindings or mouse clicks.
## Todo
Need to make possible within multiple windows of the same application. Also should make more comprehensive (misses some key presses) and user-friendly.
